2. **Market Buy/Sell** → Don't wait for better price
3. **Set Stop Loss** → At the red cross level  
4. **Set Take Profit** → At the green cross level
5. **Walk away** → Let the trade work

### After Trade

## 🚨 DEADLY MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ NEVER DO THIS
- **Trade outside prime hours** → 90% of bad trades happen off-hours
- **Take signals without all crosses visible** → Incomplete setup
- **Risk more than 3% per trade** → Account killer
- **Chase missed signals** → Entry window is 60 seconds max
- **Trade other pairs** → EUR/USD only, it's the most predictable

### ❌ EMOTIONAL TRAPS
- **"I'll just take this one signal"** outside prime time → Don't
- **"The stop is too close"** → Trust the system
- **"I'll hold for bigger profit"** → Take profit at green cross
- **"I'll skip the stop loss"** → Account killer
